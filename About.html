<h1>Hello! My name is Irfan Salahuddin and I am a student at Wake Technical community college. I am attending Wake Tech to pursue a career in cybersecurity and get my associates in  that field. For fun I like to read, watch anime, movies, and tv shows. I also am a avid video game player and collecter and love everything about them! </h1>
